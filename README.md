# DatabaseManagementAndDesign
Designed a SQL Server database for a Virtual Reality Game to create a range of tactile sensations on human body to mimic the impact of bullets and explosions.
Created stored procedures and triggers to calculate sensation levels, point of impact in a 3D plane and calculate teamscores.
Developed front end using REST, JSP, Servlets, Spring MVC framework and Hibernate to integrate the gameâ€™s User interface on web and implemented different types of backups to retrieve lost information.
